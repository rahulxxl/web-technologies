    <h1>h1. Hello MCA. This is a demo for the class.</h1>
    <h2>h2. We will study most of the HTML elemnts here.</h2>
    <h3>h3. You can take Web references. Goto <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a> for tutorial.</h3>
    <h4>h4. You should explore beyond this tutorial.</h4>
    <h5>h5. In h3, we have used anchor tag inside the h3 tag.</h5>
    <h6>h6. This is the last heading.</h6>

    <h1>For paragraph, use <strong>"p"</strong> tag.</h1>
    <p>This is paragraph written in <mark><em>p</em></mark> tag. This paragraph has some tricky whitespaces.
        to see that view the page source code     in    VS Code      and           you will see that the browser
        will ignore more than one whitespace. It will consider only one whitespace,
        and       ignore          the       rest     . Like done here.
    </p>
    <p>Browser will
        also
        ignore
        any
        newlines
        that
        you
        feed.
        In browser, the previous line will show normal but in code, you can see we have number of new lines.
    </p>
    <p>you can use <strong><em>"pre"</em></strong> tag to include new lines. We will see that <mark><strong>"pre"</strong></mark> tag
        will also apply some additional formatting, so use it only where needed.
    </p>
    <pre>
        In <strong>pre</strong> tag, Browser will
        not
        ignore
        any
        newlines
        that
        you
        feed. And it will apply some
        additional formatting.
    </pre>

    <p>You can subscript like this. X<sub>2</sub> .</p>
    <p>You can superscript like this. Y<sup>2</sup> .</p>
    <p>This word is <del>wrong</del> <ins>right</ins> .</p>
    <p>This is <mark>highlighted text.</mark></p>
